# The-Git-Gud-Team Presents Cohort Career Connecton
A place to Git Gud

Cohort Collab is a place where developers of all skill levels can come to learn something new and relax at the same time! With our design we aim to make life a little bit more easier for the developer in all of us! Take a look at a quick screenshot below!

Motivation

We were given this task to complete as part of Johns Hopkins Coding Bootcamp as a way to test our skills and use everything we have used from day one to put together an application that anyone can use the help better their everyday lives. We came up with the idea to make a one stop hub for developers instead of using google and getting a more generalized overview. 

The Build:

The framework of our project lies with Material Design Lite CSS package. https://getmdl.io/started/
There are also a few API's that are being used in the background to support our page.
https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/us/search/1? - Job search api
https://newsapi.org/v2/everything? - news articles api

As with everything this is a work in progress but we wanted to at least show the starting point to our application.
In order to get a feel for how the api's are being called as well as the different design qualities, our javascript and css pages are located in the assets/ folder. There are a lot of comments in there which will help further explain the step by step process of the project.
